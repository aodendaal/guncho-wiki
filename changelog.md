# Change log
__07:40, 8 June 2009 (UTC)__: Upgraded to Inform 7 build 5Z71, using a new framework that allows multiple I7 builds to be installed at the same time.

__05:13, 14 June 2008 (UTC)__: Fixed a library bug where action reports would sometimes be shown to players who didn't see the action occur.

__10:24, 8 June 2008 (UTC)__: Fixed a disambiguation bug introduced in the 5T18 upgrade.

__22:07, 26 May 2008 (UTC)__: Upgraded to Inform 7 build 5T18.

__02:12, 23 April 2008 (UTC)__: Added heading navigation (sections, chapters, etc.) to the code editor toolbar.

__12:39, 22 April 2008 (UTC)__: Added a JavaScript-based highlighting code editor (EditArea by Christophe Dolivet).

__00:07, 21 April 2008 (UTC)__: Added temporary guest accounts. Changed the "private" privacy level to keep other players from joining the realm at all unless they've been given access; the new "hidden" privacy level does what "private" used to do.

__12:09, 18 April 2008 (UTC)__: Added a control panel page to edit access levels on a per-player basis. Organized the realm list.

__11:52, 13 April 2008 (UTC)__: Fixed player names always being converted to title case. Fixed the library interfering with attempts to make PCs improper-named.

__23:21, 11 April 2008 (UTC)__: Added persistent storage phrases and the "realm shutdown" rulebook, allowing realms to store game state before restarting and restore it the next time they run. Added server registers for reading the current date.

__13:26, 8 April 2008 (UTC)__: Fixed control panel not accepting code that contains angle brackets. Fixed realm edit page showing confusing compiler results when certain errors occur. Fixed some problems with "who". Fixed players appearing "from the up". Disabled the NPC report rule for waiting. Added a list of players' possessions when examining them. Added directed chat (..name text, ..name :emote).

__14:09, 7 April 2008 (UTC)__: Moved "qidle" command into the library so it's available in all realms (once they're recompiled).

__09:14, 7 April 2008 (UTC)__: Fixed being able to page disconnected players, and a couple bugs introduced by the switch to Glulx.

__22:39, 6 April 2008 (UTC)__: The realms are now compiled to Glulx and run under FyreVM, courtesy of Textfyre, Inc. This means quicker response times and relaxed memory limits.

__22:47, 5 April 2008 (UTC)__: "qidle" command is available in The Outer Realm for you idlers who are behind impatient routers. (Players who get logged off after too much idling can set their MUD clients to send "qidle" every few minutes, which does nothing but keeps the connection alive.)

__11:33, 5 April 2008 (UTC)__: Fixed the realm editing box being too small on Konqueror.
