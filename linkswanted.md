# Links wanted
## Realms with links to give

List your realm here if you're already linked in and are offering links to other realms.
* The ZaraWorld below the hut in the beach is open for linking for anyone that wants to make underground realms.
* The Outer Realm has room for links of all kinds.
* About the only thing players can do in Reincarnatium right now is look at a hole. Said hole can link to some sort of aerial starting scenario. Ideally falling, as it would actually be somewhat inconvenient for the player to be able to get back (as with flying).

## Realms that need a link
