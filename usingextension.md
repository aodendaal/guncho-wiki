## Notes

Note that the extension allows you to develop, compile and test realms, however it does NOT support real-time events (i.e. no real-time event rules will ever get run while off-line) or multi-player mode (i.e. off-line, there will only ever be one PC - you - and none of the player joining or player leaving rules will get run).
A couple of extensions that improve the mockup environment (real-time events, player joing rules, storage slot emulation, etc) are listed on Peskie's user page.
