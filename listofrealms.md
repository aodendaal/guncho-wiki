## System Realms

## Realms by cassol

* Reincarnatium is going to be some kind of tie-in with some standalone IF cassol is writing.

## Realms by DavidW

* Cosmic Encounter Realm is a massive multi-planet realm based loosely on the board game Cosmic Encounter including lots of alien creatures. Step on the platform on top of the City Hall to get there. The CE Realm will evolve during its construction; visitors are always welcome. Check the leaflet in the mailbox for updates.

## Realms by Nitku

* Nitku's Studio has a game room where there will be single- and multiplayer implementations of board games and other "real life" games.

## Realms by Andrew

* The Hotel is a very simple (at the moment) realm. The author is accepting any suggestions, and if you have a room, or realm you want to link from the lift then please write about it in The Hotel's wiki page

## Realms by Peskie

* Werewolf is a very simple implementation of the game Werewolf. NPCs help round out the players if not enough PCs are playing.

## Realms by mescalin

* horrorland is a location for unspeakably dark activities. it will be soon, anyway!

## Realms by PaulDV

* MUD2.5 is going to be a port of the Grand-Daddy of all MUDs: the original Multi-User Dungeon that first started life on the Essex University's DEC PDP-10, written by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle. I just hope I can do it justice.
* Dark Winter - A post-apocalyptic/cyber-punk MUD, heavy on combat with mutli-player areas.

## Realms by Matthius

* The 7th Floor will be a mysterious floor of The Hotel with various individually unusual rooms.
* Lift Test is a small test of a real time lift that moves up and down a few floors.
