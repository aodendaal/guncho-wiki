#Guncho

Guncho is a multiplayer interactive fiction environment designed by Jesse McGrew. It was first announced on April 1, 2008 in the guise of an April Fools Day prank, and revealed the next day to be a real system. The name refers to the "guncho" spell in Infocom's game Enchanter, which banished its victims to "another plane of existence".
The system works by linking together many different realms, each running in their own virtual machines. A player can freely move between realms, leaving one body behind in the old realm and entering another body in the new realm.
Guncho currently uses version 5T18 of Inform 7 with a set of modified libraries. The realms are compiled to Glulx and run inside the FyreVM interpreter.
